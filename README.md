By Packt Publishing

It contains all the required files to run the code.

##Instructions and Navigation:

All you need to work through most of the examples in this book is a simple text or code editor, an Internet browser, and Internet access. Many of the demos use Google Chrome, so it is ideal if you have this installed; other browsers can be used, although there may be instances where you have to change the steps accordingly.

#####All of the code is organized into folders. You will see code something similar to the following:

```
body {
font-family: helvetica neue, sans-serif;
}
img {
max-width: 100%;
border-radius: 10px;
}
```
